# HotelBookingPredictiveAnalysis
Using EDA, KNN, Decision Tree Algorithms and handling class imbalances with SMOTE we will predict customer behavior in the hotel industry.

## Overview
We have a dataset from 'INN Hotels,' containing various features related to hotel bookings.
Our task is to analyze this data to uncover insights and predict booking cancellations.

## Tasks
### 1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

Inspect the dataset for anomalies and missing values.
Apply appropriate preprocessing techniques to prepare the data for analysis.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Conduct a thorough analysis using statistical summaries and data visualizations.
Explore relationships between different variables and understand booking trends.

### 3. Predictive Modeling

Implement K-nearest neighbors (KNN) and Decision Tree models to predict booking cancellations.
Evaluate and fine-tune your models to achieve the best performance.

### 4. Handling Class Imbalance with SMOTE

Understand how class imbalance in your dataset can skew the results.
Apply SMOTE to balance the dataset and retrain your models.
Compare the performance of your models before and after applying SMOTE.

### 5. Deliverables

A comprehensive report containing your EDA, model implementations, results, and insights.
The report should not only consist a basic EDA and model implementation, it should also contain an extensive insight into the dataset. Generate at least 15 questions that you would     ask from the data and answer them through visualizations.
